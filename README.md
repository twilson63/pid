# pid

this utility app helps developers to locate the CU's and SU's processes are registered too. Simply enter the pid of the process you are looking for, and it will return how long it takes to access as well as the CU and SU the process is running on.

It also shows the Nonce of the latest transaction provided from the SU.

Feel free to add more troubleshooting features.
